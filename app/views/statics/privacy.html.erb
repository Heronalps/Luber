  <h2>How we handle your information</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Luber has the highest regard for your valuable and marketable personal information. Not only do we guarantee the protection of your data, we ensure its validity by comparing it with the data collected about you with any of our hundreds of friends, such as Google or Facebook. Preferably in a non-descript location with some cash exchanging hands under a table in some dimmly-lit room.</p>
  <p>In all seriousness though, while we have implemented proper user-authetication, put gaurds around probing the site for other user's info, and done everything in terms of security by the books, don't entrust us with the password we both know you use for your email, bank account, and about every other site you go on. While we encourage you to <%= link_to 'make an account', signup_path %> and try out the functionality of our site, we suggest you use fake information for both your's and our peace of mind.</p>
